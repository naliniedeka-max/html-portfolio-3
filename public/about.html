<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! 👋
I’m a beginner developer currently learning coding through Udemy courses. I started this journey with the goal of understanding how websites and applications are built, and to gain practical, real-world skills through hands-on projects.</p>

<p>This website is a practice project, where I experiment with what I’m learning—writing code, building layouts, and improving step by step. I believe the best way to learn is by doing, making mistakes, and fixing them.</p>

<p>I’m especially interested in:

Web development

Building simple, useful projects

Learning new technologies and tools

Right now, my focus is on strengthening my fundamentals and gaining confidence as a developer. This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing.

Thanks for visiting my practice project! 🚀</p>
